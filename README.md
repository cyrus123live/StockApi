# StockAPI

This program takes the portfolio information (amounts owned and tickers of stocks) provided in myPortfolio.txt, scanning the stocks API provided by nomics for relevant information
and printing out an overview of one's portfolio, including current price of each stock, and the change in value of entire portfolio over the last day, week, month, and year.
